Project title:

	CAN Driver Development for LPC1769 using the FreeRTOS+IO framework

Project Synopsis:

	FreeRTOS+IO provides a Linux/POSIX like open(), read(), write(), ioctl() type interface to peripheral driver libraries. It currently provides support
for UART,SPI and I2C peripherals on the LPCXpresso Baseboard. Support for CAN peripheral was added by implementing a driver and FreeRTOS modifying the board support package to access the CAN peripheral through FreeRTOS+IO.


Hardware Used:

	Embedded Artist Xpresso Base Board , LPC 1769 (cortex m3) stamp.

Software Used:

	LPC Xpresso IDE.

Project Status:

	Completed.
